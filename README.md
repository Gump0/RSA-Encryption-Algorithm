# RSA Encryption Demonstration ðŸ”’

A simple C++ program written to demonstrate the beauty of the RSA encryption algorithm the internet relies so much on.
## How to Install & Run

Simply clone this repository and compile the program, ensuring that both .cpp files are considered.

For this example, I use GNU/Linux's g++ compiler.

Simply run the program in your terminal of choice and enjoy!
~~~
git clone https://github.com/Gump0/RSA-Encryption-Algorithm-Demonstration.git

g++ main.cpp WriteData.cpp -o compile

./compile
~~~
## Features

- The ability for the user to input both **p & q** values
- Encrypt any plain text message you wish! ðŸ”‘
- Conversion logic for both *Text >> Ascii **&** Ascii >> Text*
- An open source codebase that you can look at for free!
